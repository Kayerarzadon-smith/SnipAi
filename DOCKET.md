# The docket

What Kayer has asked for, and what happened to it.

`audits/LEDGER.md` holds defects **I** found in the code. This holds requests
**he** made out loud — which is the list that was actually going missing. The
fade handle is the example worth remembering: asked for, built as far as a
draggable corner, wired to nothing, and it sat dead for weeks because nothing
was keeping score.

**Status:** `open` · `done` · `partial` (some of it works, the rest is named)
· `blocked` (waiting on something outside the code — money, a credential, a
decision) · `parked` (he called it off; kept so it is not re-litigated).

Read this at the start of a session. Update it in the same commit as the work,
not afterwards. `./scripts/docket` prints what is still open.

## Roadmap — the sequence

One milestone open at a time. Nothing below gets touched until the one above
it meets its exit line. New ideas go in **Open**, not into whichever milestone
is live — they get pulled in when this list is re-sequenced, not on the spot.

**Re-sequenced 2026-09-11** — he needs TikToks posted this weekend. Drop-in
auto-cut is the product; watching it inside SnipAi's own player is not on that
path — pull the finished file from Finder (`~/Movies/SnipAi/projects/<name>/cuts/`)
and preview it in QuickTime until M-app is done.

| # | Milestone | Exit line | Ledger / docket ids |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Prove drop-in auto-cut on a brand-new clip | A raw file dropped in the dashboard today produces a finished cut in `cuts/`, no terminal touched. **Already likely true** — S3's OOM risk was fixed by commit `7d31529` before the ledger caught up; confirm on one real new clip | S3 (fixed, confirm) |
| M0.5 | Stop shipping clipped audio | `python3 qa/verify_edges.py` reports 0 of 34 | E1 |
| M-app | Make it watchable inside SnipAi itself | Open `img-9817` in the native window, press play, watch all of it | S18, S19 |
| M1 | Make the test/QA verdict trustworthy | A clean run prints one verdict; a deliberately broken run goes red | T2, T3, T4 |
| M2 | Build the net under the client | A DOM harness exists; C1 and C2 each have a test that went red → green | C1, C2 |
| M3 | Finish the three-level review loop | Level 1 → 2 → 3 usable without knowing `m` is a shortcut | H1, H2, H3 |
| M4 | Decide what SnipAi is (his call, not QA's or dev's) | Every BLOAT row has a keep/cut answer, written down | B1, B2, B5, B6 |
| M5 | Ship to a human who isn’t him | Apple Developer account bought; a build launches on Apple Silicon without Rosetta | B2, B3, B4 (docket) |

## Open

| # | What he asked for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| R2 | Products & links | The form writes a file only an uninvoked tool reads |
| R3 | Teach the take picker what "best" means to him | The machinery is connected and waiting: `takePicks` is still empty, so nothing has taught it. Needs him to override a few picks in **Takes** |

## Blocked — not on code

| # | What he asked for | Waiting on |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Post to TikTok Shop, X, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, **Pinterest**, **Trybe**, Amazon Storefront | A developer app and credentials per platform. Eight tiles, all `not_connected` |
| B2 | Hand the app to a few people | Apple Developer account, $99/yr, for signing and notarisation |
| B3 | It updates itself | Sparkle, which needs B2 first |
| B4 | Runs properly on Apple Silicon | A universal build. Works today under Rosetta |

## Parked

| # | What | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| P1 | AI overlay — the aged-neck shot, click, freeze, revert | He called it off after seeing the per-image cost. Everything but the generation call is built and committed: `ai_shot.py`, `lib/imagegen.ts`, `scripts/connect-image-provider`. One key away |

## Done

Kept because "did you do X?" is a question worth being able to answer, and
because several of these were reported twice.

| What | Where it landed |
|------|-----------------|
| Reference videos build a house-style template that is actually used | the scorecard's Pacing score reads off it — 38 on the current cut |
| Drop footage in and it cuts itself, no second step | auto pipeline, live verb and percentage |
| A real percentage while footage imports | `copying 41%`, and the row fills as a bar |
| A 1.8GB import stops taking the Mac down with it | streamed to disk: 2169MB → 149MB on a 700MB file |
| Re-score a cut without re-rendering it | the `check` step, seconds instead of minutes |
| A real timeline: two tracks, zoom, CRUD, premium UX | `Timeline.tsx` |
| Zoom with ⌘+scroll, and a toggle | timeline and snippet editor both |
| Detach audio for J/L cuts | UI, API and builder — the render script is still unrun (see ledger H4) |
| Extremely high resolution waveforms, cyan | one spike per device pixel |
| Frame-by-frame filmstrip, not a stretched smear | visible window only, ~1 frame / 44px |
| Playhead unsnapped from the grid, skinnier, exact | 1px, free-moving |
| Playhead draggable, and synced to playback | 47 position updates a second |
| Highlight a region and delete it | snippet editor, and the timeline |
| Ripple delete across synced audio and video | one drag, resolved and applied as one write |
| ⌘B to splice | plus `S` |
| Fade in / out with a draggable handle | **was dead for weeks**; the corner now ramps the clip |
| Learn rules from what I do repeatedly | and the loop was reconnected after the library moved |
| Real-time playback in the snippet monitor | canvas mirror, one decoder |
| Half-size playback window | then made resizable, then made it take the footage's shape |
| Delete projects properly, five days to change your mind | ⋯ → Delete → Recently deleted |
| Animated status bar, live percentage, estimated finish, changing verbs | transcribing, snipping, editing, shrinking, rendering |
| Thumbnail on the queue card | beside the title |
| Motion graphics and definition cards | six kinds, folded under the timeline |
| Generate a graphic for one line | about a second, off the existing transcript |
| A box that takes my voice | in the graphic dialog |
| Microphone granted without asking mid-sentence | asked for at launch |
| Sleeker trim row — just cut, slice, save | and 1px handles |
| Snippet editor as wide as its line, looking like it belongs to it | seamless with the row above |
| Space plays the snippet | and pressing it again stops |
| Save trim in the bottom right corner | |
| Nothing drawn over the picture | filename and LIVE badge removed |
| 1px between the tracks | |
| Edits applied instantly, no re-render step | 67ms — you watch the edit, not the last render |
| Stay on the cut, stop reverting to original footage | renamed **Your cut** / **Rendered file** |
| The lines carousel with playback, word lit as spoken | yields for 4s if you scroll, then comes back |
| Select a video track and have the beat row follow | selection linked both ways |
| Audio while scrubbing | 0.5× to 3×, at the speed of your hand |
| Restart the app on every change so I can see it land | every session ends bundled and relaunched |
| A 1,000-scenario QA gauntlet, run against the real app | `qa/` — 4,008 scenarios, 9 defects found, 8 fixed |
| Ten seconds of dead air gone from the cut | img-9817 111.02s → 98.5s, img-9823 184.3s → 178.9s, zero silent stretches |
| Make the app more efficient | standalone server: 250MB → 22MB |
| Darker theme, no emoji on buttons | |
| An inventory of everything built | the two published guides |
